Overload is a restaking protocol that allows you to restake any ERC-20, to any contract - and built with modularity in mind. This gives developers infinite optionality in how they want their AVS (Actively Validated Service) to reach consensus.

Overload is a permissionless restaking primitive, where you can launch your own AVSs (Actively Validated Services) without needing permission from the core team. Overload takes an approach of being a [canary](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-comparisons-kusama#canary-network) primitive (as opposed to stable) for deploying AVSs onchain. This will allow developers to iterate and deploy faster, without having to wait for core team approvals.

## Build

To build the contracts, run:

```
forge build
```
